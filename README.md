Scientific Programming for Earth and Ecological Discovery (SPEED)
=================================================================

This code was created specifically for the purposes of the SPEED class, run by [Alejandro Flores at Boise State University](https://earth.boisestate.edu/people/alejandro-n-flores/ "Lejo Flores").  As a result, the code is geared towards specific assignments and was written for the purpose of learning [in short, it was practice for me].  

It is likely there are better approaches to solving specific problems and even more likely that there are libraries already out there that solve the given problems in a superior manner.  That being said, the code can be useful to someone that is just learning to program to familiarize themselves with the way things function.

## Organization ##
The projects were divided up into Modules.  I tried to abstract away, from the Module requirements themselves, code that could be reused.  I put this code into their own modules.  The actual assignment code can be found in the modules titled Mod3-Mod14.

## Documentation ##
In an effort to practice using Python's Docstrings and a Javadoc-like program (in this case, [Epydocs](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/ "Epydocs")), I have provided generated documentation of my various classes and methods.

## Modules ##
I shall be adding to this document throughout the semester [end of 2015] to document the goals of each Module and what to look for if you download and run it.

### Module 2 ###
**Requirements:**
>In this programming assignment you will create a "Hello, world!" Python program or script.  This script will print "Hello, world!" along with a brief introduction to your screen

>Use the editor pane to write your own "Hello, World!" script.  This script should print "Hello, World!" on one line and introduce you, including your name and one characteristic, on the second line.

>**Optional**:  Assign your name and the specific characteristic as variables in the script and print the variables instead of writing out your name in the print statement and/or explore some options for formatting the text printed to your screen.

**Solution:**
I created a small "Hello World!" script that meets the requirements as well as the optional requirements.  I chose to demonstrate the print function for Python 3.x as well as the way to suppress a newline.  I provided the code to do the same thing in Python 2.x in the comments below that.
